\section{Stochastic Model}

Up to this point, only deterministic models have been accounted for. 
The deterministic models' behaviours are determined by multiple parameters such as material parameters, geometry of the structure, and the applied load. 
As these parameters are subject to uncertainties, the structural systems can be modelled as dynamic models with parametric uncertainties.
