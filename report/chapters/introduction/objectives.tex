\section{Research Objectives}
\label{sec: objectives}

The primary objective of this research is to develop and demonstrate a novel framework for uncertainty quantification of large and complex structures by combining the well-established CB method with the recently developed NI-RPCE.
Specifically, this study aims to achieve the following objectives:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Modify the CB method, optimizing it to analyze structures' dynamic responses with varying simulation parameters.
    \item Modify a sparse regression technique to work with the rational form of NI-RPCE and mitigate overfitting.
    \item Integrate the modified CB method, NI-RPCE, and the modified sparse regression technique into a framework for uncertainty quantification for large and complex structures.
    \item Demonstrates the effectiveness of the developed framework using a case study.
\end{itemize}
