\chapter{Introduction}
\label{ch: introduction}

In structural dynamics, numerical simulations play a vital role in predicting and understanding the dynamic response of engineering systems.
However, the simulation parameters are rarely, if ever, precisely known.
The development of methods to account for this uncertainty is still an active field of research.
A particular challenge is to devise strategies to cope with the computational cost associated with large and complex structures.
This thesis formulates a novel framework to tackle this challenge.
