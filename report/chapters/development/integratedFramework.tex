\section{Integrated Framework}
\label{sec: integrated framework}

This study has integrated a dynamic substructuring approach into the MCS for FRFs and developed a method to build a sparse RPCE model to reduce the required number of samples, thus reducing the computational cost of the MCS.
The last development step is combining everything into a complete framework.
Algorithm \ref{alg: integrated framework 1} and \ref{alg: integrated framework 2} depict this new framework.
