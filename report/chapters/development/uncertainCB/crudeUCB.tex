\subsection{Crude Uncertain CB Method}
\label{ssec: CUCB}

The crude UCB method is an alternative to the naive UCB method: it computes the transformation matrix using a reference structure and uses it for each sample in each frequency of interest.
In addition, it uses the original CB's transformation instead of the ECB's.
Algorithm \ref{alg: CUCB} illustrates this method.

\input{algorithms/crudeUCB}

By computing the transformation matrix only once, the computational cost becomes much lower.
This difference in computational cost becomes more pronounced as the number of frequencies and samples increases.
The crude UCB method sacrifices accuracy to reduce the computational cost: it does not account for modes' changes due to the structural parameters' variability.
