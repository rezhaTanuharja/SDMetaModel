\section{Significance of The Study}
\label{sec: significance}

This study develops a novel framework for uncertainty quantification in structural dynamics.
By combining well-established methods with a recently developed approach, the framework provides an efficient and scalable means to evaluate large and complex structures.
Beyond its immediate application, this research advances existing knowledge and facilitates future development in the field.
