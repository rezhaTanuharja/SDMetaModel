\section{Scope and Limitations}
\label{sec: scope}

This study aims to develop a new framework for uncertainty quantification of linear time-invariant structures.
The proposed framework propagates uncertainties in structural parameters to the structure's frequency response functions at discrete frequencies.
This study includes a comparative analysis between the developed framework and the direct Monte Carlo (MC) method.

While the framework is suitable for parallel computing, the focus is not on developing its high-performance implementations.
The study also uses simple numerical examples, such that the direct MC method remains feasible with the time constraints and available computational resources.
