\subsection{Cross Validation}
\label{ssec: cross validation}

A common problem of a collocation-based surrogate model is overfitting, i.e., approximating the outputs well on a given sample set but poorly everywhere else.
One possible mitigation is the cross-validation technique: one splits the sample set into a training and a test set, builds the surrogate model using the training set, and subsequently evaluates its approximation quality using the test set.

This study uses a particular class of cross-validation techniques: the leave-one-out cross-validation.
The procedure approximates an output realization using an RPCE model trained with all input realizations except one that is associated with that particular output.
Algorithm \ref{alg: looRPCE} illustrates this procedure.
